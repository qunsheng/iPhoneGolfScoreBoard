iPhoneGolfScoreBoard
====================

iOS version of golf score board.

This is my first PhoneGap application using jQuery Mobile. 
This is more a proof of concept project for me.
What I try to do is: 
1) Implement Model-View Controller design pattern by decoupling the Model and View;
2) Implement Module pattern;
3) Using namespace.
